# Arduino GPS Project

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to lead my own simple project development.

I purchased an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a gps module.  

Goal: Create a device that can use gps technology to track a dirtbike around a lap and produce the bikes lap times.
<h3> Steps to Success:</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Get device to print gps coordinates. (Initial set up)</li>
  <li> Set up I/0 device button input to mark current gps coordinates.</li>
  <li> Write algorithm to detect when gps device passes the marked gps coordinates. </li> 
  <li> Decide how to improve and device new plan of action. </li>
